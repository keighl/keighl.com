title: "Just Read the Slides"
description: "When pitching, take a few seconds to read your slide aloud. Your audience will pay closer attention to what you're saying afterwards."

My brother and I have been pitching [Clambake](http://clambakeapp.com)... a lot. Recently, the team of advisors at [GCH Partners](http://www.gchpartners.com/) took us on to help accelerate business strategy and customer development.

One of the first things they did with us was a 'pitch bootcamp'. They essentially went through every aspect of our standard presentation and fine-tuned it. They put an emphasis on brevity, clarity and some sizzle.

During one practice pitch, I was in the middle of explaining our core technology, and [Greg](https://twitter.com/ChinaGregory) stopped me suddenly. He said something along the lines of:

> "Look, I'm not even listening to you right now. You're talking and I'm reading what's on the slide. Let's read each slide out loud before you talk about it."

I studied speech communication in college, and I'm pretty sure the first thing they told us was, "don't read your PowerPoint slides." So my initial reaction was negative.

However, I took a moment to think back on some of the issues we've had with earlier pitches. People don't pay attention; I assumed that was human nature, but perhaps they were just reading our slides instead of listening.

Greg's point was this:

  * Your audience is going to read what's on the slide.
  * They will tune you out while they're reading it.
  * Therefore, take 10 seconds to read exactly what's on the slide.... and then talk about it.

It worked really well. Our next presentation felt a million times better. The four or five people in the room seemed to pay attention closer and ask better questions.

One important aspect of the **just read the slides** technique is that your slides have to be insanely simple. It can't take more than 10 seconds to read one. And this is maybe why, in college, they take points off if you read the slide aloud... it's likely that your slide is wordy and boring.
