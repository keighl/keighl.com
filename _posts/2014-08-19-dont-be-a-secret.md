During my first year building [Clambake](http://clambakeapp.com/get-it), I worked on it through the nights and over the weekends. But I was afraid to tell anyone about it… especially my coworkers at my day job. My fear was a mix of "I don't want to look dumb with a half baked product," and "will my coworkers be upset because I'm doing my own thing on the side?"

It turns out that the partners **WERE** upset when I decided to leave and pursue my own adventure. However, they were only upset that I had kept my project a secret in the first place.

More importantly, I left months of feedback, advice and testing on the table. The way I see it now, my product was nothing until I released a beta; it was non-existent even though I worked tirelessly on it. After releasing to the App Store, I had to restructure the app almost entirely within two months; I essentially tossed a years work into the recycling bin. All of the sudden I had tons of great feedback and new ideas from real users.

My whole issue was isolation. Tinkering away in the dark was a giant waste of time… I was guaranteed to be missing the mark on what people actually want.

My personal takeaways to be applied to any of my future ventures are:

* Tell everyone you know about your app/business/idea as soon as you dream it up.
* Prototype an interactive experience and test it with 5 users regularly. Don't actually build anything difficult or time consuming until you know what you should build. I've discovered [Test Tube in NYC](http://www.meetup.com/testtube/) the events are the best way to get some user hands-on with your product.
