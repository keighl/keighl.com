If you live in NYC, and you're a kick-ass developer, please come work with me. The company I work for, <a href="http://thinkfa.com">FreeAssociation</a>, is aggressively hiring developers. I need folks who have some skills in:

  * HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  * PHP, Ruby, MySQL
  * Symfony, Rails, Codeigniter, WordPress
  * Doctrine ORM
  * Compass / Sass
  * iOS
  * sysadmin chops

We have a really awesome team of designers, developers, and managers. It's a small outfit with 10-15 people at any given time. We're constantly trying new stuff, and have a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Please get in touch with us! Say, "Kyle sent me."
